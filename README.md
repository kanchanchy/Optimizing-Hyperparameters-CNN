# Optimum-Hyperparameters-CNN

Performance of a multi-layer neural network always depends on hyper-parameters such as learning rate, mini batch size, dropout rate, starting learning rate, and learning rate etc. Optimizing hyper-parameters of a multi-layer neural network is always a challenging task. This repository implements two ways of optimizing hyper-parameters and compares their performances: 1) Grid Search and 2) Bayesian Optimization.
